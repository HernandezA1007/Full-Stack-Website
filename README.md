# Full-Stack Web Application

![Homepage](./img/homepage.png)

This project is a full-stack web application based on a simple idea that mirrors my interest for technology and web development and ambitions for building computers. The website utilizes the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) and MongoDB Atlas for the database. My development journey showed me the fundamentals of full-stack programming and connecting everything together.

full README documentation soon...

## Features

- Home Page to get started and showcase
- Interactive PC Builder to choose different components and how to save the results
- Shop Services to explore computer parts provided by the database to vendors
- Typical other pages and sections that Ecommerce sites have
