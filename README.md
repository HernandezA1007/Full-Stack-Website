# Full-Stack Web Application

![Homepage](./img/homepage.png)

This project is a full-stack web application based on a simple idea that mirrors my interest for technology and web development and ambitions for building computers. The website utilizes the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) and MongoDB Atlas for the database. My development journey showed me the fundamentals of full-stack programming and connecting everything together.
